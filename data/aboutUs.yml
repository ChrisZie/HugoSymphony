  description: 'We are a Canadian and a German who met while managing and 
    volunteering at a Non-Profit Organization. We quickly realized we shared a determined passion for 
    Environmental Conservation and that we were in a unique position to utilize our knowledge and skills to 
    drastically improve the impact of NGOs and Governments who have the ultimate aim of
    protecting animal and plant life on this planet.'

  description: 'We are doing this because we learned first-hand that all the NGOs and Governments we worked with experienced 
  the same shortages: Funding, Volunteers, and Brand Awareness. Knowledge on how best to engage your 
  target audience and convert that audience into volunteers, donors, and brand ambassadors is THE critical factor limiting 
  your impact. This is ESPECIALLY true for an NGO or Government. We have that knowledge.'
