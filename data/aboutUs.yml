    volunteering at a Non-Profit Organization. We quickly realized we shared a determined passion for 
    Environmental Conservation and that we were both willing to do anything we possibly could to 
    protect animal and plant life on this planet.'

  description: 'We were incredibly excited when we learned that we shared an invaluable combination of experience, expertise, and education.
    We had both travelled, learned, and worked in several dozen countries each, giving us incredibly diverse insight. 
    We excelled at Software Development and Project Management, had several degrees and certifications in Science, Business, 
    and Technology, and had numerous years of deep first-hand knowledge in Marketing, managing volunteers, and fundraising 
    for both Non-Profit Organizations and Government Agencies.'

  description: 'We knew that our skills could serve those truly dedicated to making a positive impact on the environment.
    We left our homes, families, and careers behind to instead work around the world 
    with amazing NGOs and Governments, learning and honing our knowledge and skills with each successive project. 
    During this learning, we observed that all of the environmetally-focused NGOs and Governments we worked with seemed 
    to experience the same shortages: Funding, Volunteers, and Brand Awareness.'

  description: 'Our goal became absolutely clear: 
    to affordably provide our expertise to environmentally passionate NGOs and Governments. 
    We would deploy beautiful websites and proven, powerful Social Media strategies, provide superb Volunteer
    management training guides and coordination tools, and implement successful Fundraising systems and strategies. 
    We would provide the tools and know-how they would need to operate as world-class entities, 
    empowering them to have truly world-class impact.'
