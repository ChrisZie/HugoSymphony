  marker: learning
  description: 'The short answer: because we just can not stand by when the environment is in such peril.<br><br>
    Our experience all over the world has shown us that NGOs & Governments have great determination but are limited by the exact
    same issues: People, "Brand Awareness", & Money.
    <br><br>Because of our experience & training, we can expertly overcome these specific issues using Volunteers.'
