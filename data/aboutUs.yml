  description: 'We have years of experience in deploying large and complex resource-driven projects for organizations and Government 
    Agencies as Non-Profit Board Members, Technologists, and Project Managers.
    <br><br>This is all supported by an education in Environmental Sciences, Volunteer Leadership, Business, Technology, and Project Management.'

- caption: Why We Help 
  marker: learning
  description: 'The short answer: because we just can not stand by when the environment is in such peril.<br><br>
    NGOs and Governments have great determination but are limited by the exact
    same issues: People, Brand Awareness, and Money.
    <br><br>Our experience and training has given us the tools to address all of these issues exactly.'
