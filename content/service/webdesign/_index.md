      Your website IS your identity to the world. It is who you are, what you offer, and why the user should trust you. But to attract and keep users, you must provide excellent Design, Speed, Security, and Mobile Usability. We do that.

quizcards:
  - titlefront: MOBILE FRIENDLY
    textfront: Do You Know How Many People Will Use Only Their Phones To Find Your Website and Social Media Profiles? 
    bgimagefront: https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/04/10/23/51/dog-4118585_1280.jpg
    titleback: 52%
    textback: Over half of all users! And this number is growing FAST. But even though over half of all users use only their phones, almost no websites are built for phones and most actually perform SIGNIFICANTLY worse on a phone. <br><br>We tailor each word, image, layout, and code on your website to perform as amazingly on a phone as on a PC. Google looks at how your website performs on BOTH Mobile and Desktop when it decides who to list on their search engine so we optimize every design element to increase visibility greatly.

    textfront: Do You Know How Long A User Takes To Judge Whether They Will Stay On Your Website Or Go To Another?
    bgimagefront: https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/04/06/05/17/wallpaper-4106667_1280.jpg
    titleback: 0.05 Seconds
    textback: Half a second! That's all you have to convince a user to stay and learn about who you are and what you do. If half a second is all you have to make a difference, make it count.<br><br>We work with you to understand your themes, mission, and goals. We use that to design a spectacular website that uses colour, design effects, and layouts to optimize User Experience. And, as users clearly prefer original designs, your site will not be made from a template but rather designed just for you.

  - titlefront: SPEED
    textfront: Do You Know How Many Users You Lose When Your Website Takes Longer Than 3 Seconds to Load?
    bgimagefront: https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/04/11/00/00/animal-4118594_1280.jpg
    titleback: 20-30% Per Second
    textback: Each second costs you a QUARTER of your audience! Imagine how much more impact you could have with 75% more visitors, donors, and volunteers than you have right now.<br><br>All our designs fully consider performance, with images, colours, and content all tuned for maximum speed. Google rates template sites from Wix and WordPress a "C" grade or lower due to their awfully slow performance, making them less likely to appear during a search. Our sites have an "A" grade, vastly increasing your visibility.

  - titlefront: SECURITY
    textfront: Do You Know How Often A Hacker Targets A Small Business or Government?
    bgimagefront: https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/04/06/04/43/wallpaper-4106643_1280.jpg
    titleback: Every 39 Seconds
    textback: That's almost two sites per minute! Major organizations now spend TRILLIONS of dollars each year on improving security, making this their single largest investment.<br><br>Security is our highest priority when build websites. Vistors, volunteers, and donors should never be at risk when they trust you with their data. The most attacked websites are from WordPress, Wix, and other template sites. Our technical construction is completely different and our focus is security, guaranteeing that you are far less likely to become a victim.
