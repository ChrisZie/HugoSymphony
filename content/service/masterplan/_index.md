    textfront: How Many UNESCO Ecotourism sites, mainly Wildlife and Marine Sanctuaries, Parks, and Reserves, Have Ecotourism Management Plans?
    bgimagefront: https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/03/21/10/44/desert-1270345_1280.jpg
    titleback: 54% Of All Sites
    textback: Become a world-class destination! Without an Ecotourism Management Plan, you suffer from overtourism, lower Social Welfare, safety and legal issues, and quick site degredation.<br><br>We create a fully detailed Master Plan that provides actionable steps that can be done ASAP. We make sure that you, your staff, and your society are more capable of managing your tourism, putting in place needed guides, structures, rules, and revenue-generation mechanisms that will keep you attracting tourists for as long as you wish.

    textfront: By How Much Does Ecotourism Site Damage Decrease When Signs Are Visibly Clear, Showing Visitors What They Can And **Cannot** Do?
    bgimagefront: https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/29/05/33/bryce-canyon-1867563_1280.jpg
    titleback: A 76% Decrease
    textback: Education creates excellence! Without fully visible codes on how visitors should behave, major site damage occurs, from property damage to uncontrolled garbage and more.<br><br>As people who have managed both Non-Profits and Tourism businesses, we fully understand the challenges that exist in knowing how to create and apply behavioural codes to foreign (and even local) visitors. We create the most effective communication that overcomes language barriers and is understandable to visitors from BOTH the West and East.

    textfront: By How Much More Are Ecotourism Site Policies Followed When A Uniformed Guard Is Visibly Present During Normal Visiting Hours?
    bgimagefront: https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/01/08/18/00/antelope-canyon-1128815_1280.jpg
    titleback: A 49% Increase
    textback: Setup supporting staff! Having the right staff present in good numbers, from guards to waste collectors, is the key difference between a loved tourist site and a destroyed one.<br><br>We have staffed numerous projects and understand fully how important having the right numbers of the right staff can be. The Master Plan captures these details fully, accounting for the carrying capacity constraints of each individual Ecotourism site, and describing in detail the numbers of staff needed with all of their specific roles.

    textfront: How Much Of An Ecotourism Site's Revenue Must Be Retained By Site Staff To Ensure Ongoing Site Improvements And Maintenance?

    titleback: 50% Reinvested
    textback: Elevate their enthusiasm! Most revenue currently goes back to general government funding, resulting in lower site quality and much lower staff enthusiasm to increase revenue.<br><br>We create a fully robust Revenue Management Plan, as part of the Master Plan, that details the fee scales for both tourists and locals, how revenue should be gathered from various site revenue generators, how revenue should be allocated for optimal site imporvements, and sets values for Fines that visitors will incur for breaking any rules.
