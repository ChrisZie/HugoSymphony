    description: We meet with your team to capture the most desired design elements you may already have or want to have. We then present the initial design options, with two equally superb options for you to choose from. With the chosen option, we begin developing the final product, working closely with your team on content and branding.

    subtext: Guides and Support
    description: We transfer all administrative IDs and passwords to you and provide excellent user guides to help your staff take over the administrative tasks of making sure the website stays online after we hand it over. That will not be the end though as we will provide you with ongoing support and will assist with any moderate content changes that may come up in the future.
