  description: 'The short answer: because we absolutely will not stand by when the environment is in such peril.<br><br>
  We have seen, so many times now, that NGOs and Governments have determination but always
  find themselves limited by the exact same issues: Brand Awareness, Money, and People.<br><br>This is where we come in. 
  With all of the knowledge and training we have to address specifically those issues, it would be horrendous for us
  not to provide all the assistance we could.'
