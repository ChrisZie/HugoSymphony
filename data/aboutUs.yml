  description: 'We are a Canadian and a German who met while managing and 
    volunteering at a Non-Profit Organization. We quickly realized we shared a determined passion for 
    Environmental Conservation and that we were both willing to do anything we possibly could to 
    protect animal and plant life on this planet.'

  description: 'We were excited when we learned that we shared an invaluable combination of experience, expertise, 
  and education. We are both well-traveled Software Developers and Project Managers, we have several degrees and 
  certifications in Science, Business, and Technology, and numerous years of first-hand knowledge in Marketing, Managing 
  Volunteers, and Fundraising for both Non-Profit Organizations and Government Agencies.'

  description: 'We left our homes, families, and careers behind to instead work around the world with amazing 
  environmentally-focused NGOs and Governments, learning and honing our knowledge and skills with each successive 
  project. During this learning, we observed that all of the NGOs and Governments we worked with seemed to experience 
  the same shortages: Funding, Volunteers, and Brand Awareness.'

  description: 'We are doing this because we know, without a doubt, that knowledge on how best to engage your target 
  audience and convert that audience into volunteers, donors, or investors is the single most important factor 
  determining your success. This is true especially if you are an NGO or a Government. We are doing this because we believe that 
  those making the most important impact in our world should be the first to benefit from this specialized Marketing, 
  Volunteer Management, and Fundraising knowledge and skills that can help you have the world-class impact you should already have.'
