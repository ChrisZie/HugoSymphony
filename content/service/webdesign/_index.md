      Without question, your website is your identity to the world. It is who you are, what you offer, and why the user should trust you. But to attract and keep users, you must provide excellent Design, Speed, Security, and Mobile Usability. We do that. And, best of all, we don't bankrupt you to do it!

  - titlefront: Mobile Designed
    textfront: How Many People Use Only Their Phones To Browse Websites and Social Media?

    titleback: 52%
    textback: More than half of all users already do this are growing daily. However, though over half of users browse over Mobile, almost all websites are not built for phones and perform SIGNIFICANTLY worse for mobile users. This is true for design but much more so for speed. Google ranks websites by both Mobile and Desktop when it decides who to rank on their search engine. We tailor each and every word, image, layout, and all the technical details, to perform every bit as well on a phone as on a PC.

    textfront: Do You Know How Long a User Takes to Judge Whether They Will Stay or Leave on Your Website?

    titleback: 0.05 Seconds
    textback: Half a second. That's all you have to make your case for why a user should stay and learn about who you are and what you do. If half a second is all you have to make a difference, it should be the best half second in history. If your website looks like others, you can guarantee that the user will move on quickly. Be original and make your mark. We work with you to understand who you are. What are your themes, your intentions, your goals. We use that to design a spectacular website that understands colour psychology, technical effects, and User Optimized layouts. The user will feel at home the moment they land on your page and will grow that feeling until they leave, only to return again.

  - titlefront: SPEED
    textfront: Do You Know How Many Users You Lose When Your Website Takes Longer Than 3 Seconds to Load?
    bgimagefront: https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/04/11/11/55/small-poly-3310320_1280.jpg
    titleback: 20-30% per SECOND
    textback: Google rates websites built from templates such as Wix and WordPress a "C" grade or lower due to their extremely slow loading speeds and lower performance. Our websites have an "A" grade because we know that Speed and Performance are hugely impactful to get your page ranked highly on Google, currently used by 75% of all users to search for anything, but will also retain those users who would leave due to slow loading times and performance issues. We ensure that all designs are created speed-first. Images, colours, content, all tuned for maximum speed.
