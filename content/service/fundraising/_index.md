    textback: Almost half of all their donations! How people give donations is changing, fast. More donors prefer to donate money online, or else volunteer in-person and donate their time instead.<br><br>As management within Governments and NGOs we learned the difficult lessons on the challenges of gaining funding, as well as the overwhelming success of getting - and keeping - good funding. We will create online campaigns for you that attract the most numbers of donors and teach you how to keep those donors coming back for years.
