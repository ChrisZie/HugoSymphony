- caption: Why We Help 
  marker: learning
  description: 'The short answer: because we just can not stand by when the environment is in such peril.<br><br>
    We have seen, so many times now, that NGOs and Governments have determination but always
    find themselves limited by the exact same issues: People, Brand Awareness, and Money.<br><br>This is where we come in. 
    Our experience and training has given us the tools to address all of these issues together. 
    And, without a doubt, it all starts with Volunteers.'

  marker: launch
  description: The greatest champions for our environment are eco-focused NGOs and Governments, given the right 
    knowledge and tools.<br><br>It is fact that Volunteers are an organization's biggest marketers, donors, and skilled workforce.
    We mobilize an unstoppable team of Volunteers for you that will be your biggest champions.
    <br><br>We do so by creating end-to-end Volunteerism Solutions, including Strategic Plans, Operational Tools, 
    Web Design, Digital Marketing, and Fundraising. It's time to elevate your impact.
