    titleback: A 76% Decrease
    textback: Education creates empathy! Without proper guides and policies on how visitors behave, major damage occurs, from social conflicts to ecological destruction, and more.<br><br>As managers of Government Projects, Non-Profits Organizations, and Tourism Businesses, we know the challenge of applying behavioural codes. Our plans include fully detailed codes and policies, both as written manuals and visual aids for posters and signs, making sure that people from all parts of the world understand the policies in place.

    textfront: How Much Less Damage Do Ecotourism Sites Experience When Great Volunteers Are Present On-Site In Sufficient Numbers?
    bgimagefront: https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/01/08/18/00/antelope-canyon-1128815_1280.jpg
    titleback: A 68% Decrease
    textback: Setup supporting structures! As an NGO or Government Agency, having the right volunteers on-site in the right numbers is the best way to create fast and reliable feedback loops to site managers for immediate action to all issues.<br><br>Our experience managing numerous volunteer and project teams has taught us that a Master Plan, through measuring the carrying capacity of each site, can best capture in detail the numbers and roles of all the volunteers you need to create the most optimal feedback loops.

    titleback: Minimum 50%
    textback: Elevate their enthusiasm! Most revenue goes back to general government funding, causing lower site quality and much lower volunteer and staff enthusiasm for environmental protection.<br><br>This is by far one of the most important benefits of volunteers. Our plan details how volunteers can help you make and keep more revenue from the site, what fee structures to have, what site maintenance priorities to focus on, and what Fines to issue for rule-breaking.
